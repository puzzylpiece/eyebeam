## Plans and ideas for the future
- Expand the glyphset to match [Flexi IBM VGA](https://int10h.org/blog/2020/12/more-font-updates-oldschool-pack-flexi-vga/#flexi-ibm-vga-v2-0)
- Add more styles (Light, italic, etc.)
- Make a completely sans-serif / completely serif version
- Make a proportional version that still follows a unit system, a la the IBM Selectric typewriter
